The Story so far....

Once upon a time in a universe far away (well any universe is going to be far away from this reality), there lived a unicorn.

Their (gender unspecific) name is Ewenee.

Ewenee was sat in their beautiful pink grass that was being fanned by a gentle breeze...

They contemplated a strange, unidentified animal playing with rocks...

Suddenly, there was a loud bang, and Ewenee hid under a nearby tree.





They were the first being who played dotes...


Ewenee woke up from thier dream and realised that unicorns arent real and they were just a horse.
