The Story so far....

Once upon a time in a universe far away (well any universe is going to be far away from this reality), there lived a unicorn.


Their (gender unspecific) name is Ewenee.

Ewenee was sat in their beautiful pink grass that was being fanned by a gentle summer breeze as she is by the sea side...

They contemplated a strange, unidentified animal playing with rocks

Light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine; babbles the bee in a stolid ear...


They contemplated a strange, unidentified animal playing with rocks...

Suddenly, there was a loud bang, and Ewenee hid under a nearby tree.

A hail of bullets and meteroites tore up the land from the Skies above

They were the first being who played dotes...

Ewenee was hit by one the of the meteroites so hard they where all but obliterated from this plane of existance

As Ewenee sat enjoying the pleasant afternoon weather a boeing 747 fell out of the sky like some kind of unholy meteor, and crushed poor Ewenee.

And thats the tale of the last unicorn.


Ewenee woke up from thier dream and realised that unicorns arent real and they were just a horse. 

This was a wonderful story!

Problem? Fin.
